// ===3. Write a program that uses logical and assignment operators.

// assignment operators
let a = 3;
let b = 8;
    x = a * b;

let c = 12;
let d = 2;
    y = c * d;

let  w = d * b;       

// logical operator its answer either be true or false

z = (x == y) && (y >= x);
    console.log(z);

g = (w > x ) || (w === y);
    console.log(g);

h = (w > x ) && (w === y);
    console.log(h);
